# 🚀 Agentic GenAI App Builder

> AI-Powered Coding Assistant built with LangGraph & GPT-OSS

Agentic GenAI App Builder is an AI-driven development toolkit designed to generate and orchestrate agentic applications using LangGraph workflows and open-source GPT models. It enables rapid creation of coding assistants, project scaffolds, and intelligent automation workflows.

---

## ✨ Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an agent-based generative AI system capable of:

- Generating project templates automatically
- Acting as an AI coding assistant
- Orchestrating multi-step reasoning workflows
- Producing ready-to-run mini applications

The repository includes pre-generated example projects and a modular agent architecture for extensibility.
